**Date**: October 6, 2025  
**Status**: ✅ **ALL TASKS COMPLETED**

## Summary

The school calendar automation system has been successfully updated with two major improvements:

1. **Pickup Time Synchronization**: Novah's pickup times now automatically match Leo's schedule
2. **Complete Event Calendar**: Added all missing November and December events from the Year 2 Autumn Term PDF

---

## Task 1: Pickup Time Synchronization ✅

### Implementation
Modified the `get_pickup_time()` function to synchronize Novah's pickup times with Leo's after-school club schedule.

### Current Behavior
- **When Leo has after-school clubs**: Both children pickup at **5:30 PM**
- **When Leo has no clubs**: Both children pickup at **3:40 PM**

### Verification Results
```
TODAY (Monday, October 6):
  Leo pickup: 5:30 PM (has Chess Club)
  Novah pickup: 5:30 PM ✓ SYNCED

TOMORROW (Tuesday, October 7):
  Leo pickup: 5:30 PM (has Gymnastics)
  Novah pickup: 5:30 PM ✓ SYNCED
```

### Leo's Weekly After-School Schedule
| Day | Club | Pickup Time |
|-----|------|-------------|
| Monday | Chess Club | 5:30 PM |
| Tuesday | Gymnastics | 5:30 PM |
| Wednesday | STEM Club | 5:30 PM |
| Thursday | Drama Club | 5:30 PM |
| Friday | No clubs | 3:40 PM |

**Novah's pickup times automatically match the above schedule.**

## Future Enhancements

### Email-Based Overrides (Planned)
The system supports email-based exceptions where Novah's pickup time can be explicitly overridden:

```python
# Example usage when implementing email scanning:
get_pickup_time("Novah", day_of_week, leo_has_club, leo_pickup_override="3:45 PM")
```

This allows for situations where an email explicitly states a different pickup time for Novah.

---

## Conclusion

Both tasks have been completed successfully:

1. ✅ **Pickup Time Synchronization**: Novah's pickup times now match Leo's by default
2. ✅ **Complete Event Calendar**: All November and December events from the PDF have been added

The school calendar system is fully operational with:
- Accurate pickup time synchronization
- Complete event data for the entire Autumn Term
- Automated twice-daily updates
- GitHub integration for external application access
