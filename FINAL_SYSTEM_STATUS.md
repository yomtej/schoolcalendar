## Technical Implementation

### Synchronization Logic

**Pickup Times**:
```python
def get_pickup_time(child_name, day_of_week, has_club, leo_pickup_override=None):
    # Both children use Leo's schedule
    if has_club:
        return "5:30 PM"
    return "3:40 PM"
```

**Uniforms**:
```python
def get_uniform(child_name, day_of_week):
    # Both children have the same uniform schedule
    if day_of_week == 2 or day_of_week == 3:  # Tue/Wed
        return {"uniform": "Sports Wear", "uniformType": "Sports"}
    return {"uniform": "School Uniform", "uniformType": "Uniform"}
```

**Events**:
- AI-extracted from PDF using OpenAI GPT-4.1-mini
- 22 events covering September through December
- Automatically integrated into calendar system
