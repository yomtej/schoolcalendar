# School Calendar System Update Summary

**Date**: October 6, 2025  
**Update Type**: Pickup Time Synchronization

## Overview

The school calendar automation system has been successfully updated to synchronize Novah's pickup times with Leo's by default. This ensures both children are picked up at the same time unless explicitly overridden.

## Changes Made

### 1. Updated `get_pickup_time()` Function

**Location**: `/home/ubuntu/school-calendar-data/update_calendar_data.py` (lines 48-75)

**Changes**:
- Modified the function to accept Leo's after-school club status for Novah
- Added logic so Novah's pickup time matches Leo's schedule by default
- Maintained flexibility for future email-based overrides

**Logic**:
- When Leo has after-school clubs: **Both pickup at 5:30 PM**
- When Leo has no clubs: **Both pickup at 3:40 PM**

### 2. Updated JSON Generation Calls

**Location**: `/home/ubuntu/school-calendar-data/update_calendar_data.py`

**Today Section** (line 503):
```python
"pickup": get_pickup_time("Novah", current_date.weekday() + 1, leo_has_club_today)
```

**Tomorrow Section** (line 521):
```python
"pickup": get_pickup_time("Novah", tomorrow_date.weekday() + 1, leo_has_club_tomorrow)
```

### 3. Fixed Missing Import

**Location**: `/home/ubuntu/school-calendar-data/update_calendar_data.py` (line 11)

Added missing `import re` statement required for README timestamp updates.

### 4. Fixed Git Push Command

**Location**: `/home/ubuntu/school-calendar-data/update_calendar_data.py` (line 640)

Updated push command to:
```python
subprocess.run(["git", "push", "-u", "origin", "main"], check=True)
```

### 5. Configured GitHub Authentication

- Updated GitHub personal access token
- Configured git credentials for automated pushes
- Set up remote repository connection

## Testing Results

### ✅ JSON Generation Test
- Successfully generated JSON with synchronized pickup times
- Validation passed for all data structures
- Both children show matching pickup times

### ✅ GitHub Integration Test
- Successfully committed changes to local repository
- Successfully pushed to GitHub repository
- Verified data is accessible at: https://github.com/yomtej/schoolcalendar

### ✅ Data Verification
**Current Data (October 6, 2025)**:
- **Today (Monday)**: Leo has Chess Club → Both pickup at **5:30 PM** ✓
- **Tomorrow (Tuesday)**: Leo has Gymnastics → Both pickup at **5:30 PM** ✓

## Leo's Weekly After-School Club Schedule

| Day | Club | Pickup Time |
|-----|------|-------------|
| Monday | Chess Club | 5:30 PM |
| Tuesday | Gymnastics | 5:30 PM |
| Wednesday | STEM Club | 5:30 PM |
| Thursday | Drama Club | 5:30 PM |
| Friday | No clubs | 3:40 PM |

**Novah's pickup times now automatically match Leo's schedule above.**

## Scheduled Updates

The system continues to run automatically:
- **Morning Update**: 6:00 AM daily
- **Evening Update**: 6:00 PM daily
- **Automatic GitHub Push**: After each update
- **Log Location**: `/home/ubuntu/school-calendar-data/update.log`

## Data Access

### Raw JSON URL

```

### GitHub Repository

```

## Future Enhancements

### Email-Based Overrides (Planned)
The system is designed to support email-based exceptions where Novah's pickup time can be explicitly overridden:

```python
# Example usage when implementing email scanning:
get_pickup_time("Novah", day_of_week, leo_has_club, leo_pickup_override="3:45 PM")
```

This will allow for situations where an email explicitly states a different pickup time for Novah.

## Files Modified

1. `/home/ubuntu/school-calendar-data/update_calendar_data.py` - Main update script
2. `/home/ubuntu/school-calendar-data/school_calendar_data.json` - Generated data file
3. `/home/ubuntu/school-calendar-data/README.md` - Auto-updated timestamp
4. Git configuration files - Authentication setup

## Verification Checklist

- [x] Novah's pickup times match Leo's in "today" section
- [x] Novah's pickup times match Leo's in "tomorrow" section
- [x] JSON structure validation passes
- [x] GitHub push automation works
- [x] Scheduled tasks configured (6 AM and 6 PM)
- [x] Data accessible via raw GitHub URL
- [x] Logs being generated correctly

## System Status

**Status**: ✅ **OPERATIONAL**

The school calendar automation system is fully functional with the new pickup time synchronization feature. All tests passed successfully, and the system is ready for production use.
