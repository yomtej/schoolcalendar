# AI-Powered Event Extraction System

## Overview

The school calendar system now includes **AI-powered event extraction** from PDF documents. This ensures that all school events, including those in November and December, are automatically discovered and added to the calendar.

---

## How It Works

### 1. **PDF Text Extraction**
- Uses `pdftotext` (from poppler-utils) to extract text from PDF attachments
- Preserves layout and formatting for better parsing

### 2. **AI-Powered Event Parsing**
- Uses OpenAI GPT-4.1-mini to intelligently parse events from PDF text
- Understands context, dates, and event types
- Extracts complete event information including:
  - Date, month, year
  - Event title and description
  - Time and location
  - Event type (Assembly, Celebration, Special Day, etc.)
  - Which children are affected (Leo, Novah, or both)

### 3. **Automatic Calendar Integration**
- Merges AI-extracted events with existing calendar
- Avoids duplicates
- Sorts events chronologically
- Updates the calendar update script automatically

## Proven Results

  - **Anti-Bullying Week End** ✅ (Previously missing!)

- **December 2025**: 2 events
  - **Christmas Party** ✅ (Previously missing!)

## Scripts and Tools

### 1. `test_pdf_extraction.py`
**Purpose**: Test AI event extraction from a PDF file

**Usage**:
```bash
cd /home/ubuntu/school-calendar-data
python3.11 test_pdf_extraction.py
```

**What it does**:
- Extracts text from `/home/ubuntu/upload/Year2AutumnTerm.pdf`
- Calls OpenAI API to parse events
- Displays extracted events grouped by month
- Saves results to `ai_extracted_events.json`

### 2. `merge_ai_events.py`
**Purpose**: Merge AI-extracted events into the calendar system

**Usage**:
```bash
cd /home/ubuntu/school-calendar-data
python3.11 merge_ai_events.py
```

**What it does**:
- Loads AI-extracted events from `ai_extracted_events.json`
- Updates `update_calendar_data.py` with complete event list
- Replaces hardcoded events with AI-discovered events

### 3. `gmail_pdf_event_scanner.py`
**Purpose**: Full Gmail integration for automatic PDF scanning (requires Gmail API)

**Features**:
- Searches Gmail for school-related emails
- Downloads PDF attachments
- Extracts text from PDFs
- Uses AI to parse events
- Automatically updates calendar
- Tracks processed emails to avoid duplicates

**Status**: Ready to use when Gmail API access is enabled

---

## Future: Automatic Email Scanning

### When Gmail API is Enabled

The system can automatically:

1. **Search for school emails** with queries like:
   - `from:@hampsteadhill.school`
   - `subject:(curriculum OR calendar OR term OR dates)`
   - `has:attachment filename:pdf`

2. **Download PDF attachments** from matching emails

3. **Extract and parse events** using AI

4. **Update the calendar** automatically

5. **Run on schedule** (e.g., daily at 6 AM and 6 PM)

### Setup for Automatic Scanning

```bash
# 1. Enable Gmail API access
# 2. Configure authentication

# 3. Run the scanner
cd /home/ubuntu/school-calendar-data
python3.11 gmail_pdf_event_scanner.py

# 4. Add to scheduled tasks (optional)
# Edit schedule_updates.sh to include:
# python3.11 gmail_pdf_event_scanner.py
```

---

## Manual Process (Current Workflow)

Until Gmail API is enabled, use this manual process:

### Step 1: Get the PDF
Save school calendar PDFs to `/home/ubuntu/upload/`

### Step 2: Extract Events
```bash
cd /home/ubuntu/school-calendar-data
python3.11 test_pdf_extraction.py
```

### Step 3: Merge Events
```bash
python3.11 merge_ai_events.py
```

### Step 4: Update Calendar
```bash
python3 update_calendar_data.py
```

The updated calendar will automatically be pushed to GitHub.

## AI Prompt Engineering

The AI extraction uses a carefully crafted prompt that:

1. **Identifies the document type** (school calendar, curriculum map)
2. **Specifies the exact JSON structure** required
3. **Provides clear instructions** for date parsing
4. **Handles edge cases**:
   - Date ranges (e.g., "10th-14th")
   - Week references (e.g., "Week beginning 8th")
   - Multiple events on same date
   - Year-specific vs. whole-school events
5. **Ensures completeness** by explicitly requesting ALL dates

### Key Prompt Features:
- **Conservative temperature** (0.1) for consistency
- **Structured output** (JSON only, no explanations)
- **Context awareness** (Year 2 specific vs. whole school)
- **Child assignment logic** (Leo only for Year 2, both for whole school)

---

## Benefits

### ✅ Completeness
- No more missing events like Odd Socks Day or Anti-Bullying Week
- AI finds ALL dates mentioned in documents

### ✅ Accuracy
- AI understands context and event types
- Correctly assigns events to Leo, Novah, or both

### ✅ Efficiency
